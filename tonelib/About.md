# Tone1 Library
This is the library that the NoteStruct array slots into.

The library is a modified version of an old Arduino "Tone" library originally written by Brett Hagman.  As such, this section is not covered by the MIT licence and is instead the GPLv3 licence, with some public-domain additions of my own.
